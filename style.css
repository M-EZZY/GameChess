/*
took me long time to complete this codes, this game
i was obsessed with chess, the queen's gambit, and coding
hence this project
no initial planning or designing was done at start
it was a mess i felt in the middle
there were lots of moments where i wanted to just stop working on this
dark times
thought i could never complete this
but i finally did
it felt really good. i felt relieved and proud of myself
problems not in style file off course
but in java script files
